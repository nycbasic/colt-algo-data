Recursion
- Examples:
    JSON.parse()
    JSON.stringify()
    document.getElementById
    - Object traversal
    - See it in more complext data structures
    - cleaner code.

Call Stack
- data is placed at the top of the Stack(push)
- data is removed from the top(pop)

MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS HAVE A BASE CASE THAT RETURNS! OR A BASE CASE THAT MAKES SENSE!
