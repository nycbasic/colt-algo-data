Big O Notation: Time Complexity
    - Compares performance or test performance of code.
    - Provides a numeric performance of code.
    - Helps identify bottlenecks in specific parts of your code.
    - Explains the relationship of the input and how it changes the runtime of that code.
    - Constants don't matter.

    Counting Operations
        - Operations are considered multiplication, addition, division, and operators.

    Big O Definition
        - linear: f(n) = n
        - Quadratic: f(n) = nÂ²
        - Constant: f(n) = 1


    - Arithmetic operations are Constant run time
    - Variable assignments are Constant run time
    - Accessing elements in an array(by index) or object(by key) is constant run time.
    - In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop.

Big O Notation: Space Complexity
    - Most primitives are constant Space
    - String requires O(n) space (where n is the string length);
    - Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects).
