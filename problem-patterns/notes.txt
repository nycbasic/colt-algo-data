Frequency Patterns
    - The pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequency values.
    - This pattern can often avoid the need for nested loops O(nÂ²) operations with arrays/strings. 

Multiple Pointers
    - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle, based on a certain condition.

Sliding window Pattern
    - This pattern involves creating a window which can eiher be an array or number from one position to another.
    - Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
    - Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
